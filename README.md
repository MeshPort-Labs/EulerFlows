## What is EulerFlow?

EulerFlow is a visual workflow builder that democratizes sophisticated DeFi strategies by eliminating the need for complex solidity code or manual transaction management. Users simply drag and drop visual nodes to create advanced financial strategies that execute as single atomic transactions on Euler V2.

## The Problem

Building advanced DeFi strategies today requires extensive technical knowledge - users must understand smart contracts, write complex code, handle multiple transactions manually, and navigate MEV risks. This creates a massive barrier preventing most users from accessing sophisticated capital efficiency strategies available in protocols like EulerSwap.

## Our Solution

EulerFlow transforms complex multi-step DeFi operations into simple visual workflows. Our platform features:

- **Visual Strategy Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface with intuitive nodes for supply, borrow, withdraw, swap, and advanced strategy operations
- **Atomic Execution**: All workflows execute as single transactions using Euler V2's EVC (Ethereum Vault Connector), eliminating partial failures and MEV risks
- **Strategy Engine**: Comprehensive TypeScript backend that converts visual workflows into optimized transaction batches
- **Advanced Strategies**: Support for leveraged positions, LP collateralization, hedged liquidity provision, and JIT liquidity strategies

## Key Features

### Core Actions
- **Supply Assets**: Deposit tokens into Euler V2 vaults
- **Withdraw Assets**: Remove funds from vaults to wallet
- **Borrow Assets**: Take loans against collateral
- **Repay Debt**: Pay back borrowed amounts
- **Swap Tokens**: Exchange assets through EulerSwap pools

### Advanced Strategies
- **Leveraged Positions**: Build 2x, 3x, or higher leverage automatically
- **LP Collateralization**: Borrow against liquidity provider positions
- **Hedged LP**: Create delta-neutral liquidity positions
- **JIT Liquidity**: Just-in-time liquidity provision for capturing fees

### LP Toolkit
- **Create Pools**: Deploy new EulerSwap AMM pools
- **Manage Liquidity**: Add/remove liquidity with visual controls

## How It Works

1. **Build**: Users drag nodes onto the canvas and connect them to create their strategy workflow
2. **Configure**: Each node is configured with specific amounts, assets, and parameters
3. **Execute**: The entire workflow runs as a single atomic transaction via Euler V2 EVC
4. **Monitor**: Real-time feedback and execution status throughout the process

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with React Flow for visual node editing
- **Backend**: TypeScript strategy engine with Euler V2 integrations
- **Blockchain**: Built on Euler V2 EVC for atomic batching
- **DeFi Protocol**: EulerSwap for token swaps and liquidity operations

## Use Cases

- **Beginners**: Access advanced DeFi strategies without coding knowledge
- **Experienced Users**: Execute complex strategies efficiently in single transactions
- **Portfolio Managers**: Build and deploy sophisticated capital allocation strategies
- **Liquidity Providers**: Optimize LP positions with automated rebalancing and hedging

## Vision

EulerFlow aims to become the primary interface for interacting with the Euler ecosystem, abstracting away technical complexity while maintaining full access to the protocol's advanced capabilities. We're building the future where sophisticated DeFi strategies are accessible to everyone through intuitive visual design.
