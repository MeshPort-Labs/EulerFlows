# EulerFlow - The Visual Automation Layer for Euler Finance

**Making Advanced DeFi Strategies Accessible to Everyone**

EulerFlow is the first no-code automation layer built specifically around Euler Finance, transforming complex multi-step DeFi strategies into simple drag-and-drop workflows. Our visual builder democratizes access to Euler V2's advanced capital efficiency features by abstracting away technical complexity while maintaining the full power of the protocol.

## Project Vision

Transform Euler Finance's sophisticated infrastructure into an intuitive visual interface where users can build, simulate, and execute institutional-grade DeFi strategies without writing code, understanding smart contracts, or managing transaction complexity.

## What Makes EulerFlow Unique

### Built as Euler's Native Automation Infrastructure

**Deep Euler V2 Integration**
- Direct integration with Euler V2's Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) for atomic batch execution
- Native support for EulerSwap pools and advanced lending strategies
- Leverages Euler's sub-account system for isolated strategy execution
- Optimized specifically for Euler's unique capital efficiency features

**EVC-Native Architecture**
- Built from the ground up to leverage Euler's batch execution capabilities
- Automatic handling of controller permissions and vault interactions
- Support for cross-vault operations and sub-account management
- Gas-optimized transaction batching through EVC

### Visual Strategy Orchestration

**No-Code DeFi Strategy Builder**
- Drag-and-drop interface that maps directly to Euler's primitive operations
- Real-time workflow validation using Euler's risk parameters
- One-click execution of complex multi-vault strategies
- Strategy templates showcasing Euler's unique capabilities

**Advanced DeFi Made Simple**
Users can execute sophisticated strategies without any Solidity knowledge:
- **Leveraged Positions**: Build 3x-10x positions through automated margin, borrowing, and redeployment
- **LP Collateralization**: Use productive liquidity positions as collateral while earning fees
- **Hedged Strategies**: Create delta-neutral positions combining lending and swapping
- **JIT Liquidity**: Deploy just-in-time liquidity for enhanced fee capture

## Technical Architecture

### Visual Interface Layer

**Node Categories Mapping to Euler Operations**

**Control Nodes**
- Start/End workflow orchestration
- Euler controller permission management
- EVC batch coordination

**Core Actions (Euler Primitives)**
- Supply/Withdraw from Euler vaults
- Borrow/Repay through Euler lending
- Swap via EulerSwap integration
- Direct vault interactions

**LP Toolkit (EulerSwap Management)**
- Create new EulerSwap pools
- Add/Remove liquidity with yield optimization
- Pool management and fee collection

**Advanced Strategies (Euler's Unique Features)**
- One-click leveraged positions using Euler's capital efficiency
- LP collateralization showcasing Euler's cross-vault capabilities
- Hedged strategies combining Euler lending with EulerSwap
- JIT liquidity for institutional-grade fee capture

**Alert System**
- Real-time notifications for strategy execution
- Portfolio monitoring and risk alerts

## Demonstrating Euler's Power

### Capital Efficiency Showcase

**Example 1: LP Collateralization (Euler's Unique Feature)**
- **Goal**: User has WETH/USDC LP position earning fees, needs $5,000 DAI
- **Traditional Approach**: Remove liquidity, sell assets, lose yield
- **EulerFlow Solution**: 
 1. Drag "Borrow Against LP" node
 2. Configure: "Borrow 5,000 DAI"
 3. One-click execution through EVC batch
 4. Receive DAI while LP continues earning fees

**Behind the Scenes**: EulerFlow automatically creates EVC batch: `[Enable_LP_as_Collateral, Enable_DAI_Controller, Borrow_DAI]`

**Example 2: One-Click Leveraged Long (Euler Multi-Vault Strategy)**
- **Goal**: User has 10 WETH, wants 3x exposure
- **EulerFlow Solution**:
 1. Drag "Build Leveraged Position" node
 2. Configure: "3x WETH leverage"
 3. Automated execution with progress tracking
 4. Result: ~30 WETH position using Euler's cross-collateral system

**Execution Flow**: Supply margin → Borrow USDC → Swap to WETH → Deposit → Repeat for target leverage

### EulerSwap Integration

**JIT Liquidity Strategies**
- Deploy temporary liquidity for large trades
- Capture enhanced fees from volume spikes
- Automated withdrawal and loan repayment through Euler vaults

**Hedged LP Positions**
- Create delta-neutral positions using Euler's lending
- Combine EulerSwap LP with Euler vault borrowing
- Minimize impermanent loss while earning fees
